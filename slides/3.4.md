## ..tools might help us?
 - Annotations like *@NotNull* and **@Nullable** might help
 - But there are a [ton of
   variants](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4963300/which-notnull-java-annotation-should-i-use) and IMHO none are without problems.
 - Might help, but does not solve the problem. You can choose to ignore warnings/ide help/checkstyle errors
